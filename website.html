                    <p> Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a fantasy novel written by British author J. K. Rowling and the second novel in the Harry Potter series. The plot follows Harry's second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, during which a series of messages on the walls of the school's corridors warn that the "Chamber of Secrets" has been opened and that the "heir of Slytherin" would kill all pupils who do not come from all-magical families. These threats are found after attacks that leave residents of the school petrified. Throughout the year, Harry and his friends Ron and Hermione investigate the attacks.

                    The book was published in the United Kingdom on 2 July 1998 by Bloomsbury and later in the United States on 2 June 1999 by Scholastic Inc. Although Rowling says she found it difficult to finish the book, it won high praise and awards from critics, young readers, and the book industry, although some critics thought the story was perhaps too frightening for younger children. Much like with other novels in the series, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets triggered religious debates; some religious authorities have condemned its use of magical themes, whereas others have praised its emphasis on self-sacrifice and the way one's character is the result of one's choices.</p>

                        <p> Wings of Fire is a series of children's fantasy novels written by author Tui T. Sutherland and published by Scholastic.[1] Over 14 million copies of the books have been sold and it has been on the New York Times bestseller list for more than 122 weeks. It has also been translated into various languages, such as French. [2]

                          The series currently consists of three arcs, which focus on young dragons, called dragonets, fulfilling prophecies in a fantasy world. Each arc consists of five books, and each book centers on its own protagonist whose story is told through a third person limited perspective. At present, a total of fifteen books in the main series have been released from 2012 to 2022. [3]
                          
                          The world of Wings of Fire is made up of two continents that are populated by dragons – Pyrrhia (the focus of Books 1 through 10) and Pantala (the focus of Books 11 through 15). While Pyrrhia is home to seven tribes – MudWings, SandWings, RainWings, SkyWings, IceWings, SeaWings, and NightWings – Pantala houses only three tribes – HiveWings, SilkWings, and LeafWings. Each tribe is ruled by a queen, and each tribe also has a royal family. Both continents are also inhabited by humans (called "scavengers" by the dragons) who are seen as nothing more than animals and are even sometimes eaten. Although the later books in the third arc and the legends book called Dragonslayer[4] explore the humans of the Wings of Fire world and their interactions with dragons more thoroughly.</p>
